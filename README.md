# Abstract:
We are working towards integrating facial recognition into our everyday lives. The system will identify the user as he/she walks in through the door and play their favorite song. 

# First Iteration:
For our first iteration we have gotten the facial recognition API set up and are able to draw and test similarities between different peopleâ€™s pictures. We have also been able to set up a server to hold the data- picture of person being identified, favourite song, user name and password. 

# Technical Components:
<ul>
	<li>	We are using the face_recognition API available on Python and compatible with dlib. </li>
	<li>    We were initially thinking of using a Raspberry Pi but were not able to because of technical difficulties with installing dlib and so proceeded with just using our laptops. </li>
	<li>	We are using the Django server as our database and authentication system.  </li>
